At least on my computer, the get/post are super duper laggy. It might take a second for things to load, but they do eventually. Or, at least, I really hope so.

Originally, there was supposed to be a graph connecting all of the songs together, so you could search for linked songs. Unfortunately, my skills in JSON aren't good enough to figure out how exactly to do that. I kept the code I wrote before I started calling to the server, which is why resources/index.js is horrifying. All the relevant server calls are at the bottom of that file. 
It was also supposed to save the list of potential songs so you could narrow it down farther, but that didn't work for some reason so I gave up.  

(I absolutely procrastinated extremely hard on this and am very lucky that I somehow figured this all out.)
